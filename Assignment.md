# BSMarker - Bird Song Annotation Tool
- Create a web-based GUI to analyze and annotate bird song spectrograms automatically.
- The program will act as an interactive player of individual time frames with detected bird song segments marked.
- These annotated segments can be additionally modified by moving the boundary points.
- The program will also show computed statistics according to the annotations (duration, frequency range, pattern characteristics, etc.). 
- Use Python and its libraries as the programming language.
