# BSMarker Advanced Features Implementation Report

## Implementation Summary

All requested advanced bounding box features have been successfully implemented in the BSMarker annotation editor. The implementation follows React and TypeScript best practices with proper type safety and UI/UX standards.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Arrow Key Rewinding/Fast-Forward
**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `startRewind()` and `stopRewind()` functions to handle continuous seeking
- Uses `keydown` event to start rewinding (no `e.repeat` check needed)
- Uses `keyup` event to stop rewinding
- Implements smooth seeking with 50ms intervals
- Properly stores and restores playback state using `wasPlayingRef`
- LEFT arrow: continuous rewind backwards
- RIGHT arrow: continuous fast-forward
- Resumes playback automatically when key is released if it was playing before

**Code Location:** Lines 266-306 in `AnnotationEditor.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Bounding Box Resizing with Corner Handles
**Implementation Details:**
- Added visual corner handles (white circles with colored borders) at each corner
- Handles appear when a box is selected or part of multi-selection
- Implemented `getResizeHandle()` function to detect which handle is being hovered
- Dynamic cursor changes: `nwse-resize` for NW/SE corners, `nesw-resize` for NE/SW corners
- Maintains minimum size constraint of 10x10 pixels
- Updates time and frequency values automatically when resizing
- Smooth resizing with real-time visual feedback

**Code Location:** 
- Handle detection: Lines 408-423
- Resize logic: Lines 499-532
- Visual handles: Lines 863-892

### 3. ✅ Right-Click Context Menu
**Implementation Details:**
- Created reusable `ContextMenu` component with proper positioning
- Context menu appears at cursor position
- For bounding boxes: Edit Label, Copy, Delete options
- For empty space (when clipboard has content): Paste option
- Keyboard shortcuts displayed in menu (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Del)
- Menu auto-closes when clicking outside or pressing Escape
- Icons included for better UX (PencilIcon, ClipboardDocumentIcon, TrashIcon)

**Code Location:**
- Context menu component: `/components/ContextMenu.tsx`
- Context menu handler: Lines 610-625
- Menu integration: Lines 982-1011

### 4. ✅ Multi-Selection in View Mode
**Implementation Details:**
- Rectangular selection by click-and-drag in non-annotation mode
- Visual selection rectangle with semi-transparent blue fill
- Selected boxes highlighted with orange border
- Standard selection patterns:
  - Click: single selection
  - Shift+click: add to selection
  - Ctrl/Cmd+click: toggle selection
  - Drag: rectangular selection
- Delete key removes all selected boxes at once
- Clear visual feedback with different colors for selected vs active box

**Code Location:**
- Selection logic: Lines 459-487
- Selection rectangle update: Lines 535-558
- Visual selection rectangle: Lines 831-841

### 5. ✅ Copy/Paste Functionality
**Implementation Details:**
- Ctrl/Cmd+C: copies selected bounding box
- Ctrl/Cmd+V: pastes at last right-click position
- Clipboard buffer maintained in component state
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Works seamlessly with context menu options
- Preserves all box properties (label, time, frequency)

**Code Location:**
- Copy handler: Lines 373-378
- Paste handler: Lines 380-389
- Keyboard integration: Lines 75-82

## UI/UX Best Practices Implemented

### Cursor Styles
- ✅ `crosshair` in annotation mode
- ✅ `nwse-resize` / `nesw-resize` on corner handles
- ✅ `grabbing` while resizing
- ✅ `crosshair` during selection
- ✅ `default` in normal mode

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Hover effects on resize handles
- ✅ Different colors for selected (orange), active (red), and normal (blue) boxes
- ✅ Semi-transparent selection rectangle
- ✅ Toast notifications for actions
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- ✅ Space: Play/Pause
- ✅ A: Toggle annotation mode
- ✅ Escape: Exit mode / Clear selection
- ✅ Delete: Delete selected boxes
- ✅ Ctrl+C: Copy
- ✅ Ctrl+V: Paste
- ✅ Arrow keys: Rewind/Fast-forward (hold for continuous)

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState, useRef, useCallback) for efficient state management
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Optimized re-renders with useCallback for event handlers

### TypeScript
- All types properly defined
- No compilation errors
- Type-safe event handlers and state updates

### Performance
- Efficient event handling with proper cleanup
- Optimized canvas rendering with Konva.js
- Smooth animations at 50ms intervals for seeking

### Code Quality
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper separation of concerns
- Reusable ContextMenu component
- Follows React best practices
